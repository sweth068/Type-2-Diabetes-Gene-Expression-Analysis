# Gene Expression Analysis

Pancreatic beta-cells play a crucial role in the regulation of blood sugar levels and are central to our understanding of type 2 diabetes (T2D). In individuals with T2D, there is a distinctive interplay between these beta-cells and the progression of the disease. Beta-cells are responsible for producing and releasing insulin, a hormone essential for glucose metabolism. However, in the context of T2D, these cells often face challenges. 

This gene expression analysis revolves around a dataset focusing on pancreatic beta-cells within the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The dataset comprises samples from 10 control subjects and 10 individuals diagnosed with T2D. Obtained through laser capture microdissection, the pancreatic tissue enriches for beta-cells, shedding light on their gene expression profile.

Processed using the Affymetrix Human X3P Array (GPL1352), this dataset captures the molecular intricacies of beta-cell dynamics. The array data undergo normalization, and subsequent analysis, powered by the DNA-Chip Analyzer software, uncovers crucial insights into the genetic landscape associated with beta-cell dysfunction in early-stage T2D.

The dataset, stemming from cadaver pancreases, offers a valuable resource for understanding the underlying genetic factors contributing to beta-cell dysfunction in the context of T2D.
